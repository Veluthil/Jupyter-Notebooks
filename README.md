Welcome to the Data Science Projects Repository! This repository houses a variety of data science projects written in Python, primarily using Jupyter Notebook, and leverages a range of data analysis and machine learning libraries including pandas, matplotlib, numpy, plotly, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

## Getting Started

To explore these data science projects, simply navigate to the project's directory of interest. Each project directory contains a Jupyter Notebook file (usually with a `.ipynb` extension) where you can view the code, analysis, and results.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the projects, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy
- plotly
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy plotly seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Veluthil/Jupyter-Notebooks.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory you wish to explore.

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) for the project you want to examine.

5. Run the code cells and interact with the project as needed.
