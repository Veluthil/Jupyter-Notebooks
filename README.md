Welcome to the Data Science Projects Repository! Here, you'll find a collection of data science projects, each containing a Jupyter Notebook that includes code, analysis, and results.

## Getting Started

To explore these data science projects, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Before diving into the projects, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy
- plotly
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy plotly seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Running in Anaconda

If you prefer to use Anaconda, you have a few options:

#### Option 1: Using Anaconda Navigator

1. Open Anaconda Navigator.

2. Create a new conda environment by clicking on the "Environments" tab and then clicking "Create." Specify the Python version (e.g., 3.x) and desired package versions.

3. Activate the new environment.

4. Install Jupyter Notebook and the required packages in the environment.

#### Option 2: Using the Command Line

Alternatively, you can use the command line to create and manage environments:

```bash
conda create -n data-science-env python=3.x
conda activate data-science-env
conda install pandas matplotlib numpy plotly seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Running in Google Colab

To run these Jupyter Notebooks in Google Colab, follow these steps:

1. Open Google Colab ([https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)).

2. Click on "File" > "Upload Notebook."

3. Upload the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) for the project you want to examine.

4. In Colab, you can run code cells and interact with the project as needed.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Veluthil/Jupyter-Notebooks.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory you wish to explore.

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   - If you're using Anaconda Navigator, select your environment and click the "Launch" button next to Jupyter Notebook.
   - If you're using the command line, activate your environment (if not already activated) and run:

     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) for the project you want to examine.

5. Run the code cells and interact with the project as needed.
